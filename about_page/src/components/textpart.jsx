            <p>Consider the establishment of ‘Continuing and Digital Education Centre (CDEC)’ at MNIT Jaipur online teaching during the times of COVID pandemic has had its challenges, and it has highlighted the need for good quality digital online courses and technical content to be made available to our students at MNIT Jaipur in case of any such possible future eventuality. It is proposed to establish Continuing and Digital Education Centre (CDEC)’ with the following objectives:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>To offer facilities for the creation and conduct of digital course material and online courses.</li>
                    <li>To improve and build better interactions with industry/Government organizations through certificate courses for the continuing  educational requirement.</li>
                    <li>To create technically skilled human resources for nation-building.</li>
                    <li> To facilitate faculty members conducting various kinds of training programmes by creating a single-window service facility.</li>
                </ul>
                The proposed Continuing and Digital Education Centre (CDEC) at MNIT will facilitate organizing programmes/events such as Self-financed Short Term Courses, AICTE-QIP Courses, TEQIP sponsored Courses, GIAN Courses, NPTEL Courses, SWAYAM Courses, Industry Specific courses, Credit-based courses, Courses for Government schemes like GATI Shakti, Skill India. Successful working of such a Centre would enhance .
                1) the industry interactions, 2) provide enhanced visibility, and 3) contribute to revenue generation for the Institute. Establishing the centre would require the identification of appropriate space, providing seed funds and staff for its smooth functioning and usefulness in facilitating faculty members for their Continuing and digital education-related initiatives. However, in due course, CDEC should strive to become self-sustainable and, subsequently, a revenue-generating centre.
